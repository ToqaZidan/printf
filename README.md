# ALX Software Enginering Printf Team Project

This team project is a custom made printf function for the C programming language called _printf. This function has been optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments exactly as the printf function in the standard library. In order to receive a grade, we submitted this as part of the ALX software engineering course requirement.
